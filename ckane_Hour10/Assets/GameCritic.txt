The game is both too hard and too easy. When you are trying to play, the bumper is a bit on the small side and makes accurate bounces difficult. 
However, if you choose to just do nothing, the game will beat itself.

To make the game easier, a bigger bumper or a bumper of a different shape could be used. Extra chaos balls could be added to make the game more difficult. 
The goals could be made to be more difficult to access as well. Instead of being out in the open, maybe surround the goals with walls except on one side. 
Breakable blocks could also be added around the goals that must be destroyed before giving access to the goal.

Give the user various moves to use. Examples may include a sticky bumper, bullet time, or a dashed line that predicts where collisions will go. 
Music could also be added to the game.

The bouncing and ricocheting balls reminds me a bit of Archanoid. The chaos balls bring a bit more of a challenge and randomness that’s quite nice. 
The walking speed is too slow, therefore, to be useful, you must always hold shift to run. The bumper is a bit on the small side as well.ea
