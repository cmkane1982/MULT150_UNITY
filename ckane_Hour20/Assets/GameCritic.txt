1. 	The game is too easy. Too much time is given from powerups / there's too many powerups.
	The numerous powerups make losing almost impossible if you only collect a few. The
	obstacles are too small and are easily avoidable. This reduces any difficulty and makes
	losing difficult. Everything comes at you at the same speed. There is no variation to
	the speed of obstacles and powerups, so there is not much challenge avoiding obstacles
	and collecting powerups.
2.	I would add variable speed to the powerups and obstacles. I would also add variable sizes
	to the obstacles. Another change I would make are creating another type of obstacle that
	leads to instant game over. These would spawn at a lower rate than other obstacles.
3.	Music and sound effects would add a lot to the game. Instead of invincibility for a powerup,
	make it a gun to destroy the obstacles. Add a score counter for the obstacles destroyed. The
	score would fluctuate depending on how difficult the obstacle is to hit. Finally, occasionally
	change the scenery depending on how long you've been running.
4.	A part of what makes this game fun to play is the easy, pick up and play gameplay. The powerups
	also make the game more fun. The slowing of time when hitting the obstacles was also a fun idea.
5.	What made the game tedious is the slow, predictable rate the powerups and obstacles came towards
	the player. Also, having no sound or music takes a lot out of the game. Another aspect that was
	tedious was there was no variations to the scenery / look of obstacles.
